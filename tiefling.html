                <p>King Mendax, rules over The Petrum Urbs of Erebos, land of the mischivious tricksters, known for good deeds that come in a price, and unkown mischief. The king is not known for his strength in battle, but for his wit of trade, not having much to offer when it comes to land makes it an easy place to defend, and when you help everyone and harm everyone it's hard to make enemies. The king is constantly balancing between hated and loved. When he is hated he is protected by the Royal Knights of Erebos. nine cunning and swift fey'ri warriors always surrounding him and his wife Queen Petrum. the Fey'ri out of sight, waiting ahead and behing wherever there king is going and has been.</p><br><br>

                <h1>Fey'ri Warriors</h1>
                <p>The Warriors are not the only fey'ri in The Petrum urbs of Erebos but they are the strongest and most cunning. shrowded by the shadows they hide and wait to strike. most of the time they are purly for defense, but a little gentle persuasion and necissary every now and then.</p>

                <h1>History</h1>
                <h2>The Half Orc Viking Canibles </h2>
                <p>We were the first on the island, or so we think. we only recently started recording our happenings again after countless libraries have burned to the ground...paper is oh so flamible and our kingdom burns hotter than the pride in which we walk. we have been here along with the native half orcs and a small village of humans just north of our Glorious Kingdom. <span>The Petrum Urbs of Erebos</span>, for several generations...but should the half-orcs really count as a society? They are more like animals, causing a riot for now reason, not even a smile as they tear through the flesh of their captures. Wonderful cooks though, honestly. We have a small arrangment with them, we supply them with various raw foods, and they trade us their golds and metals, the things they think are shiny and neat, how adorable. They have no hunger for us and we have no care for anyone besides ourselves. fair trade if I do say so myself.</p>
                <h2> D'Synge </h2>
                <p>ew...rats with wings. not really much known. LITTERALY they are more stealthy then our Fey'ri warriors. and more hidden than a cowards blade. I'd be impressed but...comee on they are bats. "Born from the earth" they say "A blessing and miracle" yatta yatta yatta. We have no problems with them, they seem to have a problem with us. we are to chaotic or whatever. We have some trade deals with their more interesting tribesmen, but not many. Sometimes they kidnap for us and we trade simple blood potions and poisons.</p>
                <h2>The Chalybeate</h2>
                <p>ungrateful, we helped one of them we found a little one, aged around 10? maybe. he got lost because it was his first time out and about. so we walked him back and what's this kid do? says thanks and runs away? what nothing in return? he would've died. so one of our lower level scouts started stealing their algae supply. it makes for a good healing potion and we are VERY low supply. the price we pay for building our fortress in the mountains. But after a couple of runs we found a rare fountain a magical proportions, with a little blood magic we can turn the lakes red and rule this island. we mustn't let the Chalybeate tribe know of our secret potential so we cast low level mischief spells with some of their holy water, in reality the algea and holy water we collect is all part of a master plan to take over this island.</p>
