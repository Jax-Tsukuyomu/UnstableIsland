        <h2>Blossoming Birth</h2>
        <p>
            The Earth began as we Aurorians die, alone and empty. The shift under the bosom of the earth shook the crust. Molten rock burst forth from the earth. Spewing what seemed like her pent up aggression, the World cleansed itself once more. Every species, large or small, found itself burnt into a crisp. The World was not merciful in her removal of the trespassers. She reveled in the screams of the burning denizens on her outer skin. The people ran in an attempt to save themselves, sacrificing their "family" is necessary. Such actions only fueled the world's rage. Entire mountains burst forth, raining the melting death into the skies. Raining down from above, the manifestations of mothers anger pierced all in their wake. Man, woman, child, animal, no one was spared.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rivers, that once rushed down hillsides fueling tribes and towns, no longer ran the life-sustaining water. The many villages and towns centered around rivers and streams were made to be one with the earth again. The barricades created to redirect water to crops were destroyed. Mother's wrath had no limits. She should no sign of ending. The destruction escalated and continued for an eternity. Screams rang out to the heaven for obscene created Gods to help them. Their cries went unanswered for who could answer them? The only God in this world was the World itself. Mother had been caring and bountiful until the distortion of the land started to destroy other lands. How dare people living only because of the grace of mother cause such damage to her? The insolent fools had pushed their luck for far too long and mother found it time to cleanse herself of the infidels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time finally came in which the smoke from the burning remnants of the fallen societies broke. The sun creaked through the dark ominous clouds that populated the land. The sun even seemed apprehensive about piercing the dark veil of our Mother's anger. But all things must pass that occurs in the physical world. The outer layer of mother lay bare. Nothing moved. Nothing breathed. Nothing existed. Then came a wind blowing from mother's southern tip. The wind was warm and sweet. The aroma that came with it calmed Mother entirely, closing the openings in which the molten rock once flowed. Following the continuously sweet blowing wind, a bright green light came. The light blinded the entire universe. We had never seen such strength of light. The sun disappeared in the face of the light, conceding it's place as the main source of light if only temporarily.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bright light seemed to entice mother. Her primal urges rose with the intensity of the light. Growing, blinding, and rising, the light continued to grow. Mother could not deal with the sensations the light gave her. In a burst of energy and love, a wave caressed the world. The waves began slowly, but shifted into a rhythmic pulse. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. The pulse grew faster as if Mother had reached her limit. Her life waves were pulsing the world once again, but she was giving too much. The pulses became to intertwined that it began to blanket the world. That is when we became apart from Mother. In one last push of grace and mercy, Mother forced her children to the surface. She did not want us to disappear, but she knew that she could not protect us any longer. From the ruins of the old world, we rose from the blackened ground. The still burning earth stuck to our skin in order to give us form. The pulses became to breath life into the land restoring rivers, mountains, plains, and tundras to their former glory. And with her last breath, mother breathed life into her new children. Bring us, the Aurorian Australis, into the world. We were the protectors of this new world in Mother's stead. The earth that singed our skin proved out legitimacy. So as such we adopted the name "D'Synge" in reverence to the one true Mother.

        <h2>Adaptation of D'Synge</h2>
        <p>
            Secluded by the surrounding waterways and large bodies of water, the D'Synge people have had to adapt to their area of occupation. The area is covered above by a sun-blocking canopy that led to the deformation of the eyes overtime and an enhancement in the ear cavity. Since the majority of the day the forest floor is blanketed by shade, the D'Synge people have learned to focus only what is moving whether it is in the distance of up-close. Their overall vision has not changed, but the focus of their eyes has.
        </p>
        <p>
            The D'Synge people lead a life of modesty. Many of them are farmers and gatherers from the surrounding land. Though many are farmers many are forced into mandatory military service for the latter part of the year when the crops are not being tended to. The men are the bulk of the military force with women in positions of power. This comes fro the belief that women were made in the shape of their goddess of the Earth, Ameng'ta. This leads to women being more educated in the secular strategies and knowledge as a whole. Though some men are placed high in society for their natural aptitude for strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The race as a whole thrives in the dark; this lead to the adaptation of dark magic into something unique to them. They have dubbed it Sih'Nah or Stealth Magic. This magic is used to cover the sound and tracks of the user as well as draw the attention of unsuspecting animals in order to ensnare them. But there are some who leave the village in order to envelope themselves in the secular world. Many of whom then become assassins for the highest bidder. Thus led to the creation of Sih'Rah or Assassination Magic. This magic focuses on the enhancement of the user making them faster, quieter, and at some times become one with the shadows.

                                <p>
                                    The D'Synge people are a very strict society. If one of the people in the
                                    tribe can not be useful, they are pushed into a rigorous training session
                                    by the oldest warrior. The D'Synge believe in the tribe being only as strong
                                    as their weakest member. The problem with this is that they also believe
                                    in a family setting in the tribe. Everyone watches out for one another in the tribe.
                                    This leads to a selection that is the exact opposite of natural selection. The
                                    weakest are revived from the bottom to become one of the strongest in their
                                    particular fields. The weak are chosen based on their Coming of Age ceremony,
                                    The Shadow Hound.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Shadow Hound is a ceremony in which the males and females, that are reaching the
                                    universal age of 21, converge on the center of the village. The chief meets alone with the
                                    new recruits into the tribe's ranks. The chief pulls out oracle bones in order to divine the route
                                    for the ceremony. After finding the route, the chief silently engraves the map into each particpants
                                    memory using her magic. The participants are then branded with their own brand belonging to
                                    them and them only. The brand comes from the chiefs magic forcing the dormant magical circuits of
                                    the participants. Infused with brand new overflowing vitality and agility, the participants dart
                                    into the forest. They each have their own mission to complete. The only person who knows each
                                    particpant's mission is the chief.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As the recruits travel through the forest on their personal mission, the adults who attempted the
                                    ceremony the year before hunt. It is a tradition to weed out any who are not stealthy enough to
                                    complete a mission in which no one knows, but the person attempting the mission. The chief
                                    waits in the center of the village, meditating. Watching the entire forest for each participant and
                                    the completion of their mission. During the ceremony if the particpant's make any vocal noises,
                                    their magical circuits burst from abstaining from the lessons they were taught. The curse is lifted
                                    after the ceremony. Anyone who has their circuits destroyed are forced into being a hunter-gatherer
                                    or leaving the village from shame.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The recruits who finish the trial are greeted with hugs and kisses from the entire village. The
                                    chief comes out of her trance overtaken by the spirits of the forest because of the sustained
                                    meditation. The possessed chief walks to each successful particpant and inscribes the tribe brand
                                    on a part of their body which correspondes with the field they are most suited for based on their
                                    recent performance. The people who failed to complete their personal mission but still have their
                                    magical circuits are pushed with the head of each field in order to rise above and redeem themselves
                                    by rising the ranks in their field's skill.

                            Within the tribe, the females are dominate. Not because of a tradition, but for their physique.
                            The women are larger and better suited for combat. So in many romantic relationships that occur
                            within the tribe, the woman are the head. The are a few cases in which the males have utilized their
                            specific skill set in order to take command of the household. The only problem with male heads is the
                            female that was defeated is jeered for losing to a smaller male. The shame is minimal, but still leads
                            to slight ostricazation. The chief though can only be female and runs through the same family since the
                            creation of the tribe. This is because of the Alpha who eventually takes the throne from the previous Alpha.
                            This occurs through mortal combat that does not end until one is incapacitated.

                            Alphas are the figurehead and emotionally leader of the tribe. The lineage passes to whomever the woodland
                            spirits choose. The child who is destined to become Alpha of the tribe is determined at the time of birth. At
                            birth, the caretaker can immediately feel the difference in the room. He air becomes heavy and the forest
                            comes to a screeching halt. The Tesla Blue eyes and the Black skin tell of the story of the beginning of the
                            D'Synge. Back when they were the Aurorian Australis, the black skin was the first skin. The first light reflected
                            into the newly formed eyes was the bright blue skin. This burned into the corneas of each first born Aurorian Australis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The current leader is Saryn of the Lightning Shroud. Her birth was somewhat peculiar. Upon the day of her birth, the sky had been still for weeks. Many of the tribe felt that Mother was coming once again to punish the infidels. No wind, no animal movement, no rushing water. The world seemed to be frozen in anticipation. The old Alpha, Vala of the Swift Walk, grew old three times as fast during those weeks. The coming of the new Alpha had never drained the lifeforce of the current Alpha and the surroudning area.
                        Confusion set in and the time came for four women to give birth at the same time. The entire tribe gathered at the caretaker's clinic to
                        see the birth of the new Alpha.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first child, brown skin, pale yellow eyes, no Alpha. The next child, midnight blue skin, burnt orange
                        eyes. The third had purple skin with pale yellow eyes also. The tribe grew worried. If a new Alpha did not come, what was causing the
                        distortions in the forest? The last child was born bottom first. The caretaker pulled the legs out gently and saw what seemed like dark
                        purple skin. She began to weep. The tribe grew restless and some ran home sobbing. The caretaker continued on with the birth. As the head
                        slid from the mother, the caretaker lit up with joy. The child had the Tesla Blue eyes, but only one. . .What did this mean? No one knew,
                        but there was hope. So as Saryn grew, her skin grew darker with each passing day. Her Tesla eye began to force the other eye to change.
                        The Alpha was being created as she grew! It also seemed to give her an aptitude for the elements which frightened others while it made
                        others praise the Mother. Her closest reincarnation had been delivered.

                            The shift to Saryn of the Lightning Shround came during her
                        Shadow Hound. During her mission, she was required to save an ancient tree from destruction. Leaping in the pouring rain, Saryn jumped
                        into the empty sky. Time froze for her as the tree came into view. Lightning flew from behind Saryn and struck her back. The lightning
                        ran up her back and down her veins. The problem was it never exited. . .Returning from the Shadow Hound successfully, Saryn was greeted
                        with cheers. But the moment someone tried to touch her back, lightning sprung from her back. Even the elements seem to approve of Saryn's
                        skill and fortitude. Now every time after that incident Saryn calls upon her power to surround herself with a cloak of lightning. And so
                        the legend of Saryn of the Lightning Shroud was born.

                            The D'Synge people do not have an inherant hatred for anyone. Their way of life
                            does not allow it. The religion they allow calls for compassion and understanding
                            for all things, unless they are a target or stand in the way of the betterment of
                            the tribe. Then the entire tribe becomes a pack of wolves moving silently in the night.
                            They move in on their obstacle and strike with deadly precision. So as long as any of
                            the other races and people on the island are civil, not corrupt, and impartial to them, the
                            D'Synge continue on with their business.
