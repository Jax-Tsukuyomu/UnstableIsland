                                    The D'Synge people are a very strict society. If one of the people in the
                                    tribe can not be useful, they are pushed into a rigorous training session
                                    by the oldest warrior. The D'Synge believe in the tribe being only as strong
                                    as their weakest member. The problem with this is that they also believe
                                    in a family setting in the tribe. Everyone watches out for one another in the tribe.
                                    This leads to a selection that is the exact opposite of natural selection. The
                                    weakest are revived from the bottom to become one of the strongest in their
                                    particular fields. The weak are chosen based on their Coming of Age ceremony,
                                    The Shadow Hound.
