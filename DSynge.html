                                <p>
                                    The D'Synge people are a very strict society. If one of the people in the
                                    tribe can not be useful, they are pushed into a rigorous training session
                                    by the oldest warrior. The D'Synge believe in the tribe being only as strong
                                    as their weakest member. The problem with this is that they also believe
                                    in a family setting in the tribe. Everyone watches out for one another in the tribe.
                                    This leads to a selection that is the exact opposite of natural selection. The
                                    weakest are revived from the bottom to become one of the strongest in their
                                    particular fields. The weak are chosen based on their Coming of Age ceremony,
                                    The Shadow Hound.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Shadow Hound is a ceremony in which the males and females, that are reaching the
                                    universal age of 21, converge on the center of the village. The chief meets alone with the
                                    new recruits into the tribe's ranks. The chief pulls out oracle bones in order to divine the route
                                    for the ceremony. After finding the route, the chief silently engraves the map into each particpants
                                    memory using her magic. The participants are then branded with their own brand belonging to
                                    them and them only. The brand comes from the chiefs magic forcing the dormant magical circuits of
                                    the participants. Infused with brand new overflowing vitality and agility, the participants dart
                                    into the forest. They each have their own mission to complete. The only person who knows each
                                    particpant's mission is the chief.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As the recruits travel through the forest on their personal mission, the adults who attempted the
                                    ceremony the year before hunt. It is a tradition to weed out any who are not stealthy enough to
                                    complete a mission in which no one knows, but the person attempting the mission. The chief
                                    waits in the center of the village, meditating. Watching the entire forest for each participant and
                                    the completion of their mission. During the ceremony if the particpant's make any vocal noises,
                                    their magical circuits burst from abstaining from the lessons they were taught. The curse is lifted
                                    after the ceremony. Anyone who has their circuits destroyed are forced into being a hunter-gatherer
                                    or leaving the village from shame.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The recruits who finish the trial are greeted with hugs and kisses from the entire village. The
                                    chief comes out of her trance overtaken by the spirits of the forest because of the sustained
                                    meditation. The possessed chief walks to each successful particpant and inscribes the tribe brand
                                    on a part of their body which correspondes with the field they are most suited for based on their
                                    recent performance. The people who failed to complete their personal mission but still have their
                                    magical circuits are pushed with the head of each field in order to rise above and redeem themselves
                                    by rising the ranks in their field's skill.
