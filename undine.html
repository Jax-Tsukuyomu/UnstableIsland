      <div class="History">
        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>We are the Merpeople, the Chalybeate clan of the Undine race. We were living in unity with the rest of our clans until the Great
        Tsunami Koazi divided us. This Tsunami was so strong that all the clans were dispersed all over the world, at least that's what we
        hope for.  We ended up here on the coast of this Unstable Island, that's what we heard it was called by the natives. We are the
        proud representatives of the ocean, we are the water elementals. We have been the protectors of the all waters on the world since
         the begging of time.Our particular clan is called Chalybeate, and it means minerals. We were given this name because our food are the minerals in
        the springs we find. Luckily, we found one fountain right on the coast the island and we gave it a name Vahl. It has been our
        most important resource of food. We are a holly race, we constantly pray to our ancestors and we do not tolerate anyone who does
        bad by us, or even worse, bad by the ocean. We are very powerful beings when we get disturbed from our internal peace. We roam
        the waters all the time, to ensure nobody is trying to defy the ocean.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Present">
        <h1>Our present</h1>
        <p>Our clan has one special ability. Once our children grow up to an age of 10, they can metamorphose into Humans when they step on the land.
        We only discovered this ability recently, because we were living only in the ocean in the past. Some of our Undines decided they were going
        to live on a land forever. And because of this abolishment of our ways, they were banned from the Holly Fountain of Vahl. We do not know if
        they are still alive.

        At first, when we arrived, we had an encounter with the natives. They appeared to be the Orcs,and they were not particularly happy when
        they saw a new race on their island. They tried to take the Holly Fountain of Vahl away from us, but they failed in an unfavorable way.
        The Battle for the Vahl didn't last long enough as the Vikings didn't have a chance against our water form. So, they run away in fear and
        they never came back.

        We also had a few encounters with the bat-people but they were mostly friendly, we agreed not to disturb each other and moved on. Moreover, we
        formed an alliance to bind us if them or us are going to be attacked. We heard from them about another race that occupies this area, they are
        called Tieflings, and that they are staying out of all troubles.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Arrival">
        <h1>The Arrival</h1>
        <p>Shortly after, the Arrival happened. The sky grew darker and darker as a window in a sky opened and human-like beings entered. They looked
        like nothing we knew before. I mean they were clearly humans but they have so much equipment and metal-looking stuff with them, that we assumed
        they came from another world. They quickly inhabited the nearby island with a volcano on it and they started building some type of a city.
        We started noticing that they were dumping waste in the ocean, and it started to piss us off. Finally after they built a bridge and dumped
        the waste again, we decided to confront them. We sent three of our elders to revenge us, but all three of them got killed so easily. From that
        day on, the Zinan, that's how they called themselves, we our enemy. We had to get revenge.
